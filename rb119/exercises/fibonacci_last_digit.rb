# Fibonacci Numbers (Last Digit)
# In the previous exercise, we developed a procedural method for computing the
# value of the nth Fibonacci numbers. This method was really fast, computing
# the 20899 digit 100,001st Fibonacci sequence almost instantly.

# In this exercise, you are going to compute a method that returns the last
# digit of the nth Fibonacci number.
