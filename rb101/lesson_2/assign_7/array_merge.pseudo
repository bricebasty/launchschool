initialize 3 arrays [1,2,3] and [4,5,6] and result = [] and iterator = 0

until iterator is < than length of both arrays combined
take the next number of the first array and put it into result
take the next number of the second array and put it into result

START

SET array_1 = [1,2,3]
SET array_2 = [4,5,6]
SET array_result = []
SET iterator = 0

WHILE iterator < array_1.length
  result << array_1[iterator]
  result << array_2[iterator]
  iterator += 1
